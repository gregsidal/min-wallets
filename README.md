# Minimal Ethereum Utilities v0.60
Some small simple self-custodial Ethereum wallet and transaction tools that run locally in browser without the need for browser plugins or other installs.

The offline versions of the utilities can be used to manage wallets and sign transactions on an air-gapped device.

The tools (v0.60) are live here: https://gregsidal.github.io/min-wallets/index.html

Included are:

    Wallet manager (create and save wallets)
  
    Payments (send payment transactions)
    
    Contract Interaction (query and transact with a contract)
  
    Contract Deployment (deploy an instance of a contract)
  
    Vanity Wallet Miner (generate key-pair with a specified address prefix)
  
    Broadcast Signed Raw Transaction

Web3.js, from Ethereum foundation, is used to create key-pairs and sign transactions.  No RYO crypto primitives used.

Old version 0.50 is here: https://gregsidal.github.io/min-wallets/v050/index.html
