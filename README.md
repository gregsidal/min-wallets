## Minimal Ethereum Utilities v0.70 (July 2023)
Some small simple self-custodial Ethereum wallet and transaction tools that run locally in browser without the need for browser plugins or other installs.

The offline versions of the utilities can be used to manage wallets and sign transactions on an air-gapped device.

New to v0.70: Using the offline tools, signed transactions can be displayed as QR codes. The QR codes can be quickly scanned and broadcast to the network using the camera on a mobile device.

The tools (v0.70) are live here: https://gregsidal.github.io/min-wallets/index.html
