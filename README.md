# min-wallets
Some small simple non-custodial Ethereum wallets and utilities that run locally in browser with no dependencies (no browser plugins or other installs needed). A third-party relay (configurable "HTTP provider") is used to query the blockchain and broadcast transactions.

Offline versions of the wallets are available, which can be used to manage keys and sign transactions on an air-gapped device.

Included are:

    Account Wallet
  
    Contract Wallet
  
    Contract Deployment Wallet
  
    Vanity Wallet Miner
  
    General Address Information
  
    Broadcast Raw Transaction

All are accessible here: https://gregsidal.github.io/min-wallets/index.html
